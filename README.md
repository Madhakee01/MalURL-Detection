# MalURL-Detection
Detecting Malicious URL with Machine Learning using Python. 

I will be using scikit-learn library in python. 
Train the data using urldata.csv and create a simple classification model to determine if a url is good or bad. 

- The training dataset contains a comma separated list of urls and it's label whether good or bad. The training dataset was found online on a github repo. 


Todo list
- create a webaapp. 

Major Goals:

1. Create a webapp, maybe using streamlit or flask and host it on GCP.
