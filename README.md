# MalURL-Detection
Detecting Malicious URL with Machine Learning using Python. 

## Inspiration
Machine Learning recently has been one of the hottest technologies. I want to play around with it and better understand the concepts and algorithms. Since the idea of Machine Learning is to let the algorithm learn by itself based on theh parameters from data in order to make good predictions. Nowadays, Cybersecurity requires advanced tools and software with artificial intelligence and countless types of malware damage companies' information system. 

In this application, we will consider using ML algorithm to classify urls between ```legitimate``` or ```malicious```.


I will be using scikit-learn library in python. Train the data using urldata.csv and create a simple classification model using Logistic Regression to determine if a url is good or bad. The training dataset contains a comma separated list of urls and it's label whether good or bad. The training dataset was found online on a github repo. 

To run the web application

```git clone https://github.com/Madhakee01/MalURL-Detection.git ```

``` streamlit run streamlit.py ```

# Results

Results and examples of good and bad urls.
